public class Model {

	//	12x weight on frequency of tabla lining up with BB
	//7x weight on Maxfield values for pulse
		//it is possible that maxfield values elicit waves that are diff than the basic BB waves
	//1x weight on amplitude effect (whether it matches the waves)
	
	
	//THESE 3 things together will create some value that will be used to evaluate effectiveness of beat
	
	//Jordanova study, Person, etc will be used to add to the simulation and make it predictable for ppl
		// what type of state they fall in
		// duration of listening impacting this etc.
